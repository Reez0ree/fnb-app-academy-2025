        <h3>PANDAS</h3>
        <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas.</p>
        <p>The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Due to farming and deforestation, pandas have been driven out of lowland areas. It is a conservation reliant endangered species.</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
