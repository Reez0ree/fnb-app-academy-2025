        <h3>KOALAS</h3>
        <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus, or, inaccurately, koala bear) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae and its closest living relatives are the wombats. Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day.</p>
        <p>They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers' pouches. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, bushfires, and droughts.</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the koalas next to the giraffe enclosure.</p>
