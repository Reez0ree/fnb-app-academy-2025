        <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
        <p>Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) are wild pigs found in sub-Saharan Africa. They are bristly with facial wattles and large curved tusks. Males have longer tusks and more prominent wattles. They live in open and semiopen habitats, including arid areas.</p>
        <p>Warthogs are mostly herbivorous, feeding on grasses and roots, but they occasionally eat small animals. They are common and not currently endangered, though one subspecies, the Cape warthog, went extinct around 1865.</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the warthogs at WA11, near the elephant enclosure.</p>
