        <h3>LIONS</h3>
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the five big cats in the genus Panthera. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia, with an endangered population in India's Gir Forest. Lions are the second-largest living cats after tigers. Males can exceed 250 kg (550 lb).</p>
        <p>Lions were once widespread across Africa and Eurasia. Today, their range and population have declined due to habitat loss and conflict with humans. West African lions are especially endangered. They are vulnerable species.</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the lions at the Northern Frontier.</p>
